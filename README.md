     <h2> A little history ü§ì </h2>
  </summary>
  
          Bomberman games have two main modes: single-player campaigns and multiplayer battles. 
          In single-player, you navigate mazes, defeat enemies, and reach exits. 
          In multiplayer, the goal is to be the last player standing by strategically using bombs.
          The gameplay involves placing bombs strategically to destroy obstacles, enemies, and other players. 
          You can collect power-ups for advantages like bigger explosions or more bombs. 
          If you touch an enemy or get caught in a bomb blast, you lose.
          Apart from the classic maze games, some Bomberman titles include adventures, puzzles, and racing. 
          It's all about smart bomb placement and outlasting opponents.

  </summary>
  
             üê± Player Control
                Use the joystick to move the player LED within the matrix.
                The player LED blinks slowly, providing a visual indicator 
                of its position.
                The player can move up, down, left, right without going 
                through walls.
             üê± Wall Destruction
                Navigate the player to break walls strategically.
                Walls cover 50% - 75% of the matrix initially.
                Breaking walls contributes to the player's score.
                Remember, when generating a new map, the player is 
                strategically positioned in such a way that he can move.                
            üê± Bomb Placement
                Press the joystick button to place a bomb.
                The bomb blinks rapidly, indicating its presence.
                Bombs eliminate walls in all four directions upon 
               detonation.   
            üê± Scoring
                Score is calculated based on the time taken to win and the 
                number of walls broken.
                A bonus is awarded for each wall destroyed.              
  
            üê± Lossing the Game 
              Lives decrease when the player is within the radius of the 
              bomb at a distance of 1.
              Thus, the lives will decrease, and at the moment of 0 lives, 
              the game ends and you will be accompanied by sad music.
              
            üîî Winning the Game
                The game is won when all walls are eliminated. 
                A winning animation, accompanied by a festive jingle, is 
                displayed on the matrix. The total score, 
                including bonuses, is presented in LCD.
                
            ‚ôªÔ∏è Resetting the Game
                After the reset, you can change it again in the menu, it's your decisions. 
                Name and best score, settings will be saved        
            üîî During the Game
                On the screen you will know how many lives you will have 
                and the time is counted in real time. At the same time, 
                your name also appears.

### üìΩ Video : [ Mini Matrix Bomberman Game LCD üí£ ]
### üñ• Code : [ The Code üñ• ](https://github.com/anacimpeanu/ROBOTICS-MATRIX-PROJECT-BOMBERMAN/blob/main/BOMBERMAN_MINI_GAME.ino)
### üîå Important : 
- The red LED has too much internal resistance, and a 330 resistor further reduces the current reaching the LED
- So, for the red LED, I use a resistance of 10, so we allow a current with a higher intensity to reach the LED
- The LedControl library is properly installed and configured for the game to function correctly.
